# Outputs a string
print("I will now count my chickens:")

# Outputs tuples which are ordered finite lists where we have the kind of animal and total number
print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)

print("Now I will count the eggs:")

# Performs an arithmetic operation to count total number of eggs
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)

# Outputs a string
print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5-7?")

# Outputs a boolean value
print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)

# Outputs tuples that have an arithmetic operation
print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)

print("Oh, that's why it's False.")

print("How about some more.")
# Outputs boolean values 
print("Is it greather?", 5 > -2)
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)
