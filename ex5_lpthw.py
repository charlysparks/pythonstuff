my_name = 'Christina Yang'
my_age = 34
my_height = 66 #inches
my_weight = 180 #
my_eyes = 'Brown'
my_teeth = 'White'
my_hair = 'Black'

print(f"Let's talk about my {my_name}.")
print(f"He's {my_height} inches tall.")
print(f"He's {my_weight} pounds heavy.")
print(f"Actually that's not too heavy.")
print(f)
print(f)

# this line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
total = my_age + my_height + my_weight
print(f"If I add {my_age}, {my_height}, and {my_weight} I get {total}.")
