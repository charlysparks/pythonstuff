# Exercise 2 from Learn Python the Hard Way 
# by Zed Shaw [https://learncodethehardway.org/python/]

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored in python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")
